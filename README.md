 this is general assignment of NPTEL 
 problem statement : given 5 arrays of int elements with different size ; sort them and merge them; count how many elements in array (all of them) is repeated 3 or more times
Input format

The first line of the input contains five integers N1, N2 N3, N4 and N5, where Nj is the size of arrays j, 1 ≤ j ≤ 5. This is followed by five lines of space separated integers. For 1 ≤ j ≤ 5, line j+1 of the input has Nj integers representing the list of integer.
Output format

Your output should be a single line consisting of one integer, the total number of element in all array which are repeated 3 or more times.
